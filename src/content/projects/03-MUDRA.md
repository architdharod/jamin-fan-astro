Mudra is an Indian word, rooted in Hinduism, that denotes a single symbolic
hand gesture, of which there are many, also found in everyday life. Later
adopted by Buddhism, mudras present a direct link to the enlightened self
and the energy needed to find it. In the newest work by Hamburg-based
Taiwanese choreographer and film-maker Jasmine Fan, the different
manifestations this symbolic hand language has taken in different cultures
is explored with the underlying context of the choreographer's personal
search for the connection between her new European culture and her
Taiwanese roots.
