If mermaids are refugees from the sea, what could their dreams be about?
Waiting for the rescue, like a princess waits for her prince. While trying to
settle in the human world, these mermaids stumbled upon different
emotionally conflictual situations. Just as the author did while dancing through
the seasons of life. If we all walk in mermaid’s shoes, aren’t we all connected
while we go our own different ways?
