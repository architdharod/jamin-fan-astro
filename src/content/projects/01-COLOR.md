"Do we have the longing in us to observe other people? In Mandarin, the word
"color" has the double meaning of color and eroticism. In terms of content,
color is about the sliding transitions from neutral observing to protecting to
monitoring.

The spatial installation does not separate the audience and stage areas; the
audience, guided by the dancer, can move freely in the performance space.
The central compositional means consist of the choreography and miniature
cameras attached to the dancer's hands. The images are played back in real
time and delayed on three projection screens distributed throughout the
space. Before the performance, the audience is informed that they can
interactively influence the content of the projection through movements. For
this purpose, an installation of millimeter-wave radar sensors is being
developed in collaboration with the engineering group "Art Power" from
Taiwan, which has meanwhile created various innovative high-tech
installations for the performing arts.

With her multimedia dance performance, Taiwan-born Jasmine Fan and an
international team explore the interrelationships of observation and
surveillance. The piece runs through three sequences: Embedded in a very
sensual choreography, the film layer of this first sequence shows images that
the dancer creates of herself with her finger cameras.

In the process, the boundaries between reality and illusion can be experienced. In a second
sequence, a criminal story is told on film that the author herself had
experienced in relation to surveillance cameras.

In the last part, the dancer "watches" the audience with her cameras, who can prevent the camera
recording by moving. Animated by the dancer and the music, the piece ends
in a collective dance, free of surveillance images. Last but not least, the
dance performance is intended to stimulate reflection on the widespread
ignorance of modern societies towards the effects of increasing surveillance
on our lives.
