What comes after, when one day we must say goodbye to the world? Is
there consciousness after death?Which longings draw us back to life? 
BARDO tells the story of the encounter in the transitional realm of Bardo
between the young deceased monk, Duoje, and his teacher, Sun-Moon-
Light. In this place, described in Tibetan Buddhism as the space between
heaven, hell, and rebirth, Duoje's soul is faced with the choice between
dissolution in Nirvana or rebirth in a real human body.

Taking the form of both
a live performance and a live-stream, the choreographic sequences that
embody these innerconflicts form dialogues between the two souls in Bardo,
immersing the viewer's gaze in the story. The audience is allowed to move
freely between the performers, experiencing the accompanying camera,
which directs the perspective of the viewers to intentional points in the
choreography, through live projection.
